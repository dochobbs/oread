# Chronic Conditions for Time Travel

## Selection Criteria

A condition is well-suited for Time Travel if it has:
- **Distinct stages**: Evolution over time, not binary presence/absence
- **Decision points**: Clinical choices that affect trajectory
- **Prevalence**: Common enough that learners will encounter it
- **Time span**: Arc measured in years, not weeks
- **Interconnection**: Links to other conditions (comorbidity patterns)

## Open Questions

1. **Branching vs. linear**: Some conditions have multiple possible endpoints (asthma → resolution vs. severe persistent). How complex should branching be?

2. **Comorbidity modeling**: When ADHD + anxiety co-occur, do we model them independently or as linked? The latter is more realistic but harder.

3. **Treatment effects**: Should good treatment modify progression probability? Realistic but adds complexity.

4. **Severity spectrums**: Some conditions (autism, ID) exist on spectrums. How to model without being reductive?

5. **Age-dependent presentations**: Same condition presents differently at 4 vs 14 (e.g., depression). Worth modeling presentation shifts?
